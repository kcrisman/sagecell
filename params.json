{"name":"Sagecell","body":"This is a Sage computation web service.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to install the Sage Cell server is to install the\r\nexperimental spkg for Sage.\r\n\r\n#. Install Sage 5.0 (tested on 5.0 beta 12)\r\n#. Install the new Sage Notebook (instructions at `Trac 11080 <http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/11080>`_)\r\n#. Install the `spkg <http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/sagecell-0.9.0.spkg>`_::\r\n\r\n    sage -i http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/sagecell-0.9.0.spkg\r\n\r\nThen open up two terminals.  In the first, launch the webserver::\r\n\r\n    cd $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagecell\r\n    sage ./start_web.py\r\n\r\nIn the second terminal, launch the worker processes::\r\n\r\n    cd $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagecell\r\n    sage ./start_device.py\r\n\r\nOpen your browser to http://localhost:8080/ and have fun!\r\n\r\nYou can update your codebase to the latest cutting-edge version by\r\ndoing::\r\n\r\n    cd $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagecell\r\n    git pull\r\n\r\nThe biggest potential troublesome spot in the installation is that it\r\nhas to apply two patches to Sage using queues.  If you have\r\nuncommitted changes, or if you have conflicts, the installation will\r\nproceed, but you may have problems.\r\n\r\nThe default configuration is not secure, so you'll need to do more\r\nwork to harden the system to open it up to outside users.  But at\r\nleast that should get you up and running for a personal/development\r\nserver.  See the :doc:`Advanced Installation <advanced_installation>`\r\nguide for more details about setting up a server outside of a Sage\r\ndirectory and making your server more secure and scalable.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nSee the :download:`LICENSE.txt <../LICENSE.txt>` file for terms and conditions for usage and a\r\nDISCLAIMER OF ALL WARRANTIES.\r\n\r\nBrowser Compatibility\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nThe Sage Cell Server is designed to be compatible with recent versions of:\r\n\r\n* Google Chrome\r\n* Firefox\r\n* Safari\r\n* Opera\r\n* Internet Explorer (8+)\r\n\r\nIf you notice issues with any of these browsers, please let us know.\r\n\r\n","tagline":"The Sage Cell Server---providing a way to embed Sage computations into any web page.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
